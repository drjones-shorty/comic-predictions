Through cat's-paws both super powered and mundane they tried to break him, but every attempt failed. But now they've made a mistake by kidnapping the person closest to him and sacrificing her to their dark masters, THE GIBBORIM. Tony will do everything to get her back, including attacking The Pride on their own turf ... with some surprise guest-stars in tow!!!", | Iron Man, | editor:Charlie Beckerman | penciller (cover):Juan Doe | penciller:Steve Kurth | writer:Fred Van Lente,, | onsaleDate:2011-01-05T00:00:00-0500 | focDate:2010-12-12T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2013-04-08T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.99 ,2011,1
