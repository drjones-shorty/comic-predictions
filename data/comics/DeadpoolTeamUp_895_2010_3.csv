28873,Deadpool Team-Up (2009) #895,895,28573,75,"""HARD AS ROCK"" Off the coast of the Galápagos Islands, something hideous, something so deliciously amoral has vanquished the tranquility and shattered the peace - DEADPOOL! The legend no one can forget has been missing for years...yes, we're talking about It! The Living Colossus, the 30-foot-tall stone statue brought to life by wheelchair-bound Robert ""Bob"" O'Bryan. Enlisted by O'Bryan's niece, Deadpool takes a dive, plunging down to the ocean floor in search of the stone statue. But something more heinous than Deadpool's thoughts when he's watching lingerie football lurks in the ocean depths. And underwater, nobody can hear your hilarious one-liners!
