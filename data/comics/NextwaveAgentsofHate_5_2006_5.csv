NEXTWAVE has Dirk Anger and his evil organization H.A.T.E..  Soap?  Nope.  NEXTWAVE has a battle between H.A.T.E. and Nextwave in #4.  Soap is only at #2 with no H.A.T.E. at all!  NEXTWAVE has all of your family members held ransom.  Soap doesn't even know your family.  Four out of five dentists prefer Nextwave to soap.  In fact, they were so emphatic in their preference, they beat up the fifth dentist and he fell in line.  So five out of five dentists prefer NEXTWAVE.  So will you!  Part 1 (of 2)!<br>32 PGS./Parental Advisory ...$2.99<br>",, | letterer:Chris Eliopoulos | writer:Warren Ellis | inker:Wade von Grawbadger | penciller (cover):Stuart Immonen | colorist:Dave McCaig,, | onsaleDate:2006-05-24T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2008-07-24T00:00:00-0400 | digitalPurchaseDate:2011-01-25T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:2.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99
