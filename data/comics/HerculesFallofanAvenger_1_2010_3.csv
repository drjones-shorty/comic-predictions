30722,Hercules: Fall of an Avenger (2010) #1,1,23038,90,"When the most beloved Olympian of all time falls, who will mourn him?  Acclaimed INCREDIBLE HULK artist Ariel Olivetti joins writers Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente for a two-part mini-epic that marks the end of an era and the beginning of something utterly unexpected for Hercules, the Lion of Olympus.  Bring your hankies -- and your golden adamantine maces -- as an all-star cast including Thor, Namor, Namora, Snowbird, Alflyse, Bruce Banner, and of course, Amadeus Cho send off the Son of Zeus with shocking tales, smash-tastic action, bawdy tomfoolery, and heart-rending drama that will change the course of Marvel's marvelous mythological milieu... forever!  Plus: There are some missions that require a woman's touch- so the rest of the Agents of Atlas hang back and let Venus and Namora go out and show their stuff!
