5222,Punisher (2004) #39,39,33947,52,"""Man of Stone,"" Part 3,2006,10<br>The mountains of Afghanistan.  It's here that General Nikolai Alexandrovich Zakharov got his nickname: ""Man of Stone.""   While bullets bounced off the rocks at his feet and  hardened men scrambled for cover, Zakharov stood his ground.  And what he did next -- what he did next has haunted the dreams of the mujahideen ever since.  What he did next showed them the depths of his resolve.  That was years ago.  Now, General Zakharov has returned to these scorched plains with one thing in mind: Revenge on the man with whom he played chicken on the grandest scale.  That man is Frank Castle -- a.k.a. the Punisher -- and he, too knows a thing about resolve.<br>32 PGS./Explicit Content ...$2.99<br>", | Punisher, | penciller (cover):Tim Bradstreet | colorist:Dan Brown | writer:Garth Ennis | penciller:Leandro Fernandez | letterer:Randy Gentile,, | onsaleDate:2006-10-11T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:2.99
