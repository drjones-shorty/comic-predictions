And after barely surviving an encounter with the Marauders' secret weapon, the young X-Man feels a strange, inexplicable pull towards the land of the rising sun. Of course, it can't be a coincidence that said secret weapon is also stalking the streets of Tokyo, right?  It's gonna take more than just one claw for Kitty to make it through round two!!
