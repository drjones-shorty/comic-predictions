Created in 1975 by Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes, the original Omega The Unknown lasted only ten issues but was a legend to those who recall it -- an ahead-of-its-time tale of an anti-hero, inflected with brilliant ambiguity. One of Omega's teenage fans was award-winning novelist Jonathan Lethem, who has used the original as a springboard for a superbly strange, funny, and moving graphic novel in ten chapters.,2007,10<br>32 PGS./Rated T+...$2.99 <br>",, | penciller (cover):Farel Dalrymple | colorist:Paul Hornschemeier | writer:Jonathan Lethem | writer:Karl Rusnak,, | onsaleDate:2007-10-03T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2009-04-02T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.99
