1464,Captain America & the Falcon (2004) #10,10,23234,96,"""BROTHERS & KEEPERS (ADELPHOITE PHYLAXES)"" PART 3 (OF 5),2004,12<br>The Falcon's increasingly erratic behavior has created sharp conflict between Captain America and himself. While Cap works with S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Ali Morales and S.H.I.E.L.D. commander Nick Fury to track down the deadly A.I.M. leader M.O.D.O.K. and ferret out MODOK's connection to rogue Naval Intelligence Admiral ""Jimmy"" Westbrook, Falcon proceeds on his own track, unleashing the newly-restored and re-powered Anti-Cap to help destroy the Rivas drug cartel, and, hopefully, bag Admiral Jimmy and MODOK at the same time.
