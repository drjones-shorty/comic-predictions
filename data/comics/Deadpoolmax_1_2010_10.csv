32219,Deadpool Max (2010) #1,1,29176,70,"""HEADS UP"" When the world has a problem that's bigger than any government, special ops team, or C.I.A. smart bomb can solve, they call in the one man crazy enough to solve it: Deadpool.  Possibly unkillable mercenary, definite weapons expert and swordsman, hopeless romantic, nutjob.  It's that last part that presents a small problem and that's where Agent Bob steps in.  Bob's sole charge in life is to point Deadpool at the problem and pull the trigger -- not any easy task when your agent is a dime short of a dollar and three cards shy of a full deck, and even harder when you've gone deep cover in the impenetrable fortress of Hammerhead, the Grand Don of the most powerful criminal organization in the world, and your unkillable super agent is head over heels for a busty French maid baker named Inga...well, you begin to see the inherent problems of the job.  But no one can take it like Bob, no one can dish it like Deadpool, and no one can show you every last detail if it like MAX!  You may think you know Deadpool ...you have no idea.
