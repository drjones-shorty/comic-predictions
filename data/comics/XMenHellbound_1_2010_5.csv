When Magik is gravely injured in battle, she instinctively flees to the sanctuary of Limbo...only to fall into the clutches of a longtime adversary hoping to wrest the powerful Soulsword-and control of Limbo-from her grasp. Now, a small team of X-Men venture in after her, but they are met only by unexpected peril: a horde of demons out for blood, Magik nowhere in sight, and a concealed evil walking amongst them.
