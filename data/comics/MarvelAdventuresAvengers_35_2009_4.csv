But how does one go about meeting a normal girl when living the life of a super hero? The solution seems to be an online dating service called Lover's Leap, but when Hawkeye accidentally downloads a wealth of sensitive Avengers information onto the website, which (dang!) turns out to be a scam site run by Batroc the Leaper, it's going to take the combined fighting might of the Avengers to get Hawkeye out of this jam!
