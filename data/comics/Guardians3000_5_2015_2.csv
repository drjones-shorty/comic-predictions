But the Old Hunger is the most powerful entity in the Galaxy, and it's not a good idea to wake him up... or to by-pass his invincible herald, Stormfront! Meanwhile, Vance Astro has encountered a Guardian that he forgot ever existed, and she's none too happy about his memory blank. Time to make friends again fast... before the A-Sentience gestalt of The Stark destroys them all! Cosmic action and mind-blowing SF adventure!",, | writer:Dan Abnett | penciller (cover):Alex Ross | artist:Gerardo Sandoval,, | onsaleDate:2015-02-11T00:00:00-0500 | focDate:2015-01-28T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2015-08-10T00:00:00-0400 | digitalPurchaseDate:2015-02-11T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:3.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:3.99
