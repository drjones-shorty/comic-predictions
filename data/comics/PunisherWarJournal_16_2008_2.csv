20667,Punisher War Journal (2006) #16,16,32488,56,"The Punisher isn't known for taking prisoners-so what's life like for those rare few that DO survive their run-ins with Frank Castle?  When we last saw The Gibbon, he'd been poisoned and blown up by the Punisher and left to roast alive in a bar full of his D-List cohorts.  And today?
