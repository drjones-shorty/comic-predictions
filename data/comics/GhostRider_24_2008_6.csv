21351,Ghost Rider (2006) #24,24,24485,88,"What do you get when you take a maximum security prison filled with sinners of every sort and add a bonafide Spirit of Vengeance to the mix?  A hot time in the old hoosegow, that's what you get.  In this first part of an all-new arc, Blaze goes behind bars, still hell-bent on vengeance, still looking for answers.  But is he prepared to face the mysterious man in cell 17?  The one with the sign on his door that says ""Do not open under any circumstances""?  The one who just got set loose?  Uh oh.  Bring your riot gear.
