33860,Punisher: In the Blood (2010) #4,4,14861,124,"Who is the gorgeous, leather-clad, burn victim romantically entangled with both the Jigsaw Brothers? The answer will twist the knife buried deep in the belly of Frank Castle. The answer will shred his soul. The Punisher has fought his way though a hurricane of broken glass, nothing has broken him. He fought on. But no longer. Not after today. Not after the final revenge of The Jigsaw Brothers. The Punisher will never recover from this.",, | penciller:Roland Boschi | writer:Rick Remender | penciller (cover):J.S.
