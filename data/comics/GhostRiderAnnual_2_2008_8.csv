The Ghost Rider must now track down Lucifer and send him back to where he came from before the Devil succeeds in creating a new Hell...here on earth. This is no small task, but it is further complicated by both the fact that Lucifer hides behind many faces and that there are those-one very strange man, in particular-who would prefer Ghost Rider cease his mission immediately...or else.
