Even with their numbers at a record low, the world refuses to trust mutantkind...and after a mutant-triggered international incident, anti-mutant hatred hits new heights. Of course it's at this moment, when the mutant race needs most to stand together, that a split begins that will tear apart the very foundation of the X-Men. From superstar writer and Marvel Architect Jason Aaron and a full roster of comics' top artists, this is an X-tale that will reverberate for years to come! Come October, the X-Men landscape will be irreparably changed.", | Cyclops | Sentinels | Wolverine | X-Men, | writer:Jason Aaron | editor:Nick Lowe | penciller:Carlos Pacheco, | X-Men: Schism, | onsaleDate:2011-07-13T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2011-06-29T00:00:00-0400 | unlimitedDate:2013-04-08T00:00:00-0400 | digitalPurchaseDate:2011-07-13T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:4.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99 ,2011,8
