32232,Deadpool Max (2010) #4,4,19238,75,"""NO CABLE NO FUTURE"" For years, when Uncle Sam needed to erase untouchable global madmen, it called on the legendary super-agent known as Cable.  That is, until two years ago, Cable disappeared for parts unknown...and a certain Merc with a Mouth took up the slack.  But now Cable has reemerged from where he claims is the far-flung future to take back his old job.  How will that sit with Deadpool?  Like Tacos before bedtime.  It's super-agent vs super-agent in a fight to the finish.", | Cable | Deadpool, | editor:Axel Alonso | penciller (cover):Kyle Baker | writer:David Lapham,, | onsaleDate:2011-01-19T00:00:00-0500 | focDate:2011-01-04T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:3.99 ,2011,1
