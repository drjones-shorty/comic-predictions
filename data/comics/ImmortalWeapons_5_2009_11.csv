But as Danny Rand, the Immortal Iron Fist, soon learned, the forbidding Prince of Orphans was no more than an Earth-born man, John Aman, given great power and trained for ages countless. Yet questions remain...what is Aman's mission on Earth? What is the nature of his incredible power? And is there anyone who can defeat his kung fu? When Iron Fist joins Aman on a life-or-death mission to fight monsters and banish ghosts, Danny may learn the answers to these questions...if he survives!
