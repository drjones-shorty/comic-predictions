As the armies of darkness begin their initial attacks, Thor confronts Loki, who is destined to usher in the fall of Asgard. But what he learns from the Loki may change the way he sees his treacherous half-brother. For perhaps this terrible event is a time also of renewal. Perhaps in this desperate hour even the God of Lies has a purpose. 32 PGS./All Ages ...$2.99 ", | Thor, | Writer:PAUL JENKINS | penciller:Ariel Olivetti,, | onsaleDate:2011-07-20T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2011-07-06T00:00:00-0400 | unlimitedDate:2012-08-07T00:00:00-0400 | digitalPurchaseDate:2011-08-10T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99,2011,7
