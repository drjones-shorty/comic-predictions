His left wrist is broken, and the other is badly lacerated so he's guessing he went insane and snapped the handcuffs.   On top of that, they had to reinflate his lung.  How the scene played out is a mystery.  But one thing's for sure.  Barracuda has the prize.  A 7-pound, 10-ounce bundle of joy.  And the Punisher will do anything to get it back.<br>32 PGS./Explicit Content ...$2.99<br>", | Punisher, | penciller (cover):Tim Bradstreet | colorist:Dan Brown | writer:Garth Ennis | penciller:Goran Parlov | letterer:Cory Petit,, | onsaleDate:2007-10-10T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:2.99
