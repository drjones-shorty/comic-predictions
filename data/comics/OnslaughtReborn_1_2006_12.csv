5532,Onslaught Reborn (2006) #1,1,3540,256,"Marvel's greatest heroes sacrificed themselves to save the world from the deadliest threat they had ever faced-Onslaught! The lives of the Fantastic Four and the Avengers were saved only when Franklin Richards created a parallel universe, where we found those heroes, reborn! But this world has long since merged back into our own, and the evil Onslaught-forged from the most vile parts of Magneto's and Professor X's psyches-has been presumed long dead... but now he, himself, is reborn-and he's bringing fragments of the other universe with him! Join comics superstars Jeph Loeb and Rob Liefeld in this no-holds-barred, all-out action extravaganza-celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the event that changed Marvel history-as Onslaught, the Marvel Universe, and the Heroes Reborn Universe collide in this massive crossover!  A significant portion of the proceeds from ONSLAUGHT REBORN #1-5 will be donated to The Sam Loeb College Scholarship Fund."",2006,12<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ ...$2.99<br>", | Captain America | Franklin Richards | Invisible Woman | Iron Man | Thing, | penciller (cover):Rob Liefeld | writer:Jeph Loeb | letterer:Richard Starkings,, | onsaleDate:2006-11-29T00:00:00-0500 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2009-10-09T00:00:00-0400 | digitalPurchaseDate:2011-03-16T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99
