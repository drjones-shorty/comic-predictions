52792,The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl (2015) #7,7,19801,130,"Our friend Squirrel Girl doesn't like our new friend Girl Squirrel! In this issue we'll discover if this dislike is... POTENTIALLY JUSTIFIED?? Also: if you don't care whether or not these two people like each other, perhaps me telling you that THE WORLD HAS GONE MAD AND SQUIRREL GIRL HAS TO FIGHT THE AVENGERS IN THIS ISSUE will attract your attention? It did? Well guess what: she also fights Ratatoskr, the Norse God of squirrels! Also, Old Guy Thor is in this issue! As is New Lady Thor! We don't have Frog Thor, though. That seems like an oversight, actually??",, | penciller (cover):Erica Henderson | writer:Ryan North,, | onsaleDate:2015-07-01T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2015-06-17T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:3.99
