51361,Angela: Asgard's Assassin (2014) #3,3,31096,63,"The Tenth Realm of Heven crashes into... wait, which number is Vanaheim? Well, Vanaheim. We're going to Vanaheim for adventures, fun and bleak existential horror! Does Loki join the pursuit of Angela and her tiny, diaper-wearing charge? Well, we'd have to be really cruel to mention him here if he's not going to turn up. Loki Lies, not solicits. Solicits are always 100% honest. Plus, find out why saying ""All good angels go to heaven"" would get you stabbed by Angela. She's a little touchy on the topic of the afterlife.",, | writer:Marguerite Bennett | writer:Kieron Gillen | penciller (cover):Stephanie Hans | artist:Phil Jimenez,, | onsaleDate:2015-02-04T00:00:00-0500 | focDate:2015-01-21T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2015-08-03T00:00:00-0400 | digitalPurchaseDate:2015-02-04T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:3.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:3.99
