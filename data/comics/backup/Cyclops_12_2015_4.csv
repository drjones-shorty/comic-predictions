50463,Cyclops (2014) #12,12,26516,114,"If power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, whaddaya think near-infinite cosmic power granted by the Black Vortex does? Jean Grey is about to find out, which spells very bad news for both Jean Grey-- and the universe! But there's one man who might be able to stop her, who might be able to save her... except in this case it's not exactly a man, it's a 16-year-old space-pirate-in-training and (maybe) the love of Jean Grey's life... Scott Summers. Can Cyclops save the day? Maybe. But we can't guarantee he'll survive the experience.
