50462,Cyclops (2014) #11,11,14481,148,"Rescuing the life of the pirate captain who wants your father dead? Probably a bad idea. Revealing who you really are to the pirate girl who thinks she's in love with you? Possibly even worse. And doing both while trapped on a hostile planet full of angry Shi'ar? No doubt a fatal error! Tune in for the action-packed climax of ""A Pirate's Life for Me,"" and witness what will no doubt be the horrific deaths of Cyclops, Corsair and the Starjammers!
