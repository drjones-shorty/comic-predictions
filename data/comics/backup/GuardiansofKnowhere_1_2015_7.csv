53702,Guardians of Knowhere (2015) #1,1,81902,10,"A single moon orbits Battleworld. But no, that's no moon. It's a space station. It's Knowhere. The head of a dead Celestial, somehow saved in the universal collapse, a colony brimming with convicts and criminals. The Galaxy may be gone, but that doesn't mean there aren't places that still need heroes. Places that need champions. That need GUARDIANS.",, | writer:Brian Michael Bendis | penciller (cover):Mike Deodato,, | onsaleDate:2015-07-15T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2015-06-22T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:3.99
