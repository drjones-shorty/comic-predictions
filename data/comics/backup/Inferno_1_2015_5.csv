The X-Men fought to vanquish the demon horde and... The X-Men failed. Welcome back to the Inferno. On this the fifth anniversary of Manhattan's fall, Piotr Rasputin is leading a small band of mutants back into the Inferno. Colossus doesn't know what they'll find on the other side of those flames but he knows for certain... They're not coming back without his sister.
