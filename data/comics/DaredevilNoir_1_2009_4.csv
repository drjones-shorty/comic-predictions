Prohibition-era Hell's Kitchen is Kingpin territory, and until now, his only problem has been the masked vigilante known as Daredevil. When gangster Orville Halloran arrives on the scene, fresh from a stretch in Sing Sing and eager to stretch his wings, Hell's about to get hotter. For P.I. Foggy Nelson and his loyal assistant Matt Murdock, it all starts when a desperate woman comes to their office with an irresistible story about her and Halloran. To Foggy, she's a client -- to Murdock, she's enough to make Halloran Daredevil's next target. But Murdock is about to find out that half-truths are poison truths, and that the Kitchen is full of history that will put him on a collision course with both the old Kingpin and the man who wants to replace him.<br>Parental Advisory ...$3.99<br>",, | colorist:Dan Brown | colorist:Daniel Freedman | letterer:Joe Caramagna | inker:Tomm Coker | other:Chris Eliopoulos | writer:Alexander Irvine,, | onsaleDate:2009-04-08T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2009-03-19T00:00:00-0400 | unlimitedDate:2009-11-16T00:00:00-0500 | digitalPurchaseDate:2012-07-03T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:3.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99
