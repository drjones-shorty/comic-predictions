It's juuuuuust a little job that needs doing, but this is Hercules; isn't he supposed to be REALLY good at doing labors himself?  Before they know it, Iron Man, Spider-Man and the Hulk are stuck looking after Orthus and Cerberus, the two legendary hounds of the underworld! Luckily, the dogs learn to behave after chewing up only a few cars, a statue, and Iron Man, and finally they're obedient enough for the Metro Dog Show! Only problem, Hercules wants the dogs back. Oh no, Herc, not before the Hulk gets his ribbon! It's two dogs with five heads between them, and all the action you can handle. ,2010,4<br>All Ages ...$2.99 <br>",, | colorist:Guru-eFX | colorist:Emily Warren | inker:Roger Cruz | inker:Terry Pallot | penciller:Alvin Lee | letterer:Nate Piekos | writer:Paul Tobin,, | onsaleDate:2008-07-23T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2008-07-03T00:00:00-0400 | unlimitedDate:2009-11-19T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:2.99
