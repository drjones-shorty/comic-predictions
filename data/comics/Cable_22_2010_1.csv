Finally, after years of being stuck in a one-way trip to oblivion, Cable and Hope leap into the past.  But the Mutant Messiah and her surrogate father miss the mark by more than a few hundred years, finding themselves in a primitive Manhattan - and hunted by a mutant who just doesn't know the meaning of the word ""quit.""
