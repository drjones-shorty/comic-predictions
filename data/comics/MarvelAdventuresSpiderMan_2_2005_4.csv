1891,Marvel Adventures Spider-Man (2005) #2,2,10304,154,"""THE SINISTER SIX!"" Part 1 (of 2)  What separates the super-villains from just plain old villains? When they escape from prison, regular villains might lay low for a while and enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.  But not a super-villain like Doctor Octopus--the minute he's free, he's gathering up the most dangerous crew ever assembled: the Vulture, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Sandman and Mysterio! And they've all got one thing on their minds: bringing down Spider-Man once and for all! As if that weren't enough for this two-part epic, maybe we should mention that Spidey's powers are on the fritz, and he's only got the abilities of...a regular teenager?!", | Spider-Man, | colorist:Guru-eFX | penciller (cover):Tony Daniel | writer:Erica David | inker:Norman Lee | penciller:Patrick Scherberger | letterer:Dave Sharpe,, | onsaleDate:2005-04-06T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2007-11-13T00:00:00-0500 | digitalPurchaseDate:2010-08-05T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.5 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99,2005,4
