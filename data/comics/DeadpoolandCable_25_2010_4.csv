29932,Deadpool & Cable (2010) #25,25,38424,37,"""TWO MUTANTS AND A BABY"" DOUBLE-SIZED FINAL ISSUE CO-STARRING DEADPOOL! You know, before that red-headed would-be messiah/destroyer of the world showed up, Cable had another partner.  That's right: Wade Wilson -- a.k.a. Deadpool!  And while everybody's excited about Cable bringing Hope back to the present to rejoin the X-Men, they're forgetting the most important part of the story: The beginning, back when Cable first lifted the helpless baby out of her incubator up in Alaska.  Wait -- You don't think Cable did that alone, did you?  You don't think he managed to make his way across hundreds of miles, avoiding Predator X and Purifiers without a little assist, do you?  Hell no. Cable asked for help from his favorite Merc with a Mouth and now, finally, this action-packed, oversized story can be told.  Before there can be an end, there must be a beginning.
