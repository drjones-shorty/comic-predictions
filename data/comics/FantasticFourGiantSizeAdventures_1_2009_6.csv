And what do Egghead and his 70 foot tall friend, Gargantua have to do with it? A lot, really. And so do the Invincible Man, Psycho-Man, Basilisk, Cobalt Man, Xeron the Star Slayer, the Terror Birds and a host of other bad guys aiming to take down the World's Greatest Fighting Family by any means necessary! Plus, artist Colleen Coover helps bring you Sue Storm's essay, ""The Importance of Being Invisible.""
