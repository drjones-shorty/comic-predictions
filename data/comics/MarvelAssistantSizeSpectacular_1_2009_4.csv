In the beloved tradition of Assistant Editors' Month, we the staffers are sick and tired of our bosses telling nothing but Wolverine stories, Spider-Man stories, Captain America stories...and we're taking matters into our own oddball hands! Little guys can be heroes, too...and when this motley crew of misfits gets their shot - in stories featuring Elsa Bloodstone, American Eagle, D-Man, the daughter of Galactus, Mini Marvel cake-eating Hawkeye, Candidate Luke Cage, and more - it could be the start of something big! Don't miss this two-issue anthology of also-rans who might - just MIGHT - ascend to the A-list! (Fingers crossed. Really we're just hoping this doesn't get us fired.),2009,4<br>Rated A ...$3.99<br>",, | penciller:Jacob Chabot | penciller:David Williams | writer:Chris Eliopoulos | writer:BRIAN PATCHETT | inker:Chris Giarrusso | inker:XURXO PENALTA | colorist:Laura Martin | colorist:Jose Villarrubia | letterer:Nate Piekos | letterer:Dave Sharpe,, | onsaleDate:2009-04-01T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2009-03-12T00:00:00-0400 | unlimitedDate:2011-04-07T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:3.99
