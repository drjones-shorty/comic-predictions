17246,Punisher War Journal (2006) #13,13,41768,55,"""HUNTER/HUNTED,"" Part 1 of 3,2007,11<br>The reintroduction of a classic, brutal, and bloodthirsty Kraven the Hunter.  A bank robbery goes violently wrong, leaving the Rhino on the lam, running from the long arm of the law and, of course, the Punisher.  As Frank Castle looks to settle the score with an old foe, the Hunter stalks the same prey, building himself the ultimate menagerie -- a living, breathing super-human zoo!   Add Spider-Man into this mix as the lone voice of sanity and super-special guest artist Cory Walker (THE IRREDEEMABLE ANT-MAN, Invincible) and you've got chocolate and peanut butter with bullets dipped in it.  Delicious! Violent!  Explodey!  <br>RATED T+ ...$2.99<br>",, | letterer:Joe Caramagna | writer:Matt Fraction | penciller (cover):Ariel Olivetti | colorist:Dave Stewart | inker:Cory Walker,, | onsaleDate:2007-11-14T00:00:00-0500 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2008-10-27T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.99
