It's almost always a signal that learning will be put on hold for the day, replaced by a glorified study hall or the occasional 1950s film strip. But Peter Parker should know by now that days off aren't quite so easy to come by... especially when this particular substitute has a strange interest in Peter's extra-curricular activites as the school's resident super hero, the Amazing Spider-Man!
