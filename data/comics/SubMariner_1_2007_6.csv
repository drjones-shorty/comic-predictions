Fresh off his key appearances in CIVIL WAR and WOLVERINE, Marvel's first mutant returns in his own limited series that will forever change the way we look at Namor and Atlantis. A horrendous terrorist attack has struck the U.S., and all clues point to an Atlantean sleeper cell. Now, Namor finds himself in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s crosshairs.  But is Namor to blame?  Or is this merely the first strike orchestrated by those within Atlantis who would see Namor stripped of his title and his kingdom?  The half-human, half-Atlantean son of two worlds must race between the sea and the surface to track down those responsible for the attack before Tony Stark, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. - a.k.a. Iron Man - takes him down!  Written by Matt Cherniss and Peter Johnson (POWERLESS) with art by the internationally acclaimed Phil Briones (WHITE TIGER) and a first cover by superstar-artist Michael Turner!<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ ...$2.99 <br>", | Sub-Mariner, | penciller:Philippe Briones | writer:Matt Cherniss | colorist:Paul Mounts | penciller (cover):Michael Turner, | Initiative, | onsaleDate:2007-06-13T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2008-02-20T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:2.99
