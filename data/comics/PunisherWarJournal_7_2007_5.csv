With that line, the all-new Hate Monger begins the execution ceremony of the Punisher -- and nothing will ever be the same.  Massacre after brutal massacre along the border brought Frank to the desert, but what horrible things does he find hiding behind the killings?  What atrocities could possibly drive Frank to don a new costume?  And how could it all go so terribly wrong?  The American dream continues to become an unholy nightmare for Frank and everybody else in his orbit.<br>32 PGS./Rated T+ ...$2.99 <br>",, | letterer:Joe Caramagna | writer:Matt Fraction | penciller (cover):Ariel Olivetti, | Initiative, | onsaleDate:2007-05-09T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2008-04-17T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.99
