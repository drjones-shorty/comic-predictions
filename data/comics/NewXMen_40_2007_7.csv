Most are captives of the devil-ish Belasco who will kill them to get what he wants.  But who is this girl who bears a striking resemblance to a certain Russian mutant who died years ago?  And does she mean help or harm to the New X-Men?  Either way, one has lost his heart.  Another will lose her soul.  <br><br>32 PGS./Rated T+ ...$2.99<br>", | X-Men, | writer:Craig Kyle | writer:Chris Yost | inker:Sean Parsons | letterer:Dave Sharpe | penciller (cover):Skottie Young,, | onsaleDate:2007-07-18T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:-0001-11-30T00:00:00-0500 | unlimitedDate:2008-06-11T00:00:00-0400 | digitalPurchaseDate:2010-06-01T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:2.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99
