33840,Halo: Fall of Reach - Covenant (2010) #2,2,7825,205,"After being nearly destroyed in an attack by a Covenant craft, the UNSC frigate Commonwealth is in bad shape. Before the Covenant ship can return for a second attack, the Spartans set out to overtake it. And, with the new Mjolnir armor - the single most cutting-edge piece of technology developed since the Spartans themselves - they're a force to be reckoned with. But the Covenant is still an unknown quantity, and it may take more than the Spartans' new armor to stop them.",, | writer:Brian Reed | penciller (cover):Felix Ruiz,, | onsaleDate:2011-07-27T00:00:00-0400 | focDate:2011-07-13T00:00:00-0400, | printPrice:3.99 ,2011,7
