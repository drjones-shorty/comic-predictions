29755,Black Widow (2010) #8,8,14856,125,"""KISS OR KILL,"" PART 3 Your name is Nick Crane. You've met this beautiful girl, and you're traveling all over Eastern Europe. It'd be like some crazy romantic comedy, except for... well, the secret government torture rooms. The black hood (that smells like garlic) over your head. The kidnapping, the poison mist, the gunfire, the chase through the bitter cold and the train derailing. And now there's this crazy guy in a robot suit and some messed-up witch-looking woman coming after you, and the only thing between you and them is that beautiful girl, who calls herself Black Widow... and you know, you kind of think she still may have killed your father. Duane Swierczynski and Manuel Garcia's new era for the super-spy Avenger known as Black Widow continues here! Jump on now before the thrill-packed, globe-hopping, bone-snapping crossover with HAWKEYE AND MOCKINGBIRD kicks off next month. 32 PGS./Rated T  ...$2.99", | Black Widow | Crimson Dynamo, | colorist:Jim Charalampidis | inker:Travel Foreman | inker:Lorenzo Ruggiero | penciller:Manuel Garcia | editor:Ralph Macchio | editor:Joe Quesada | letterer:Nate Piekos | writer:Duane Swierczynski,, | onsaleDate:2010-11-24T00:00:00-0500 | focDate:2010-11-04T00:00:00-0400 | unlimitedDate:2011-11-22T00:00:00-0500 | digitalPurchaseDate:2011-02-08T00:00:00-0500, | printPrice:2.99 | digitalPurchasePrice:1.99 ,2010,11
